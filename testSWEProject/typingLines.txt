Maria likes pie.
Pie is good.
Order is weird.
This is last.
That is not last.
The people
By the water
You and I
He called me.
What did they say?
No way
One or two
More than the other
How many words?
This is a good day.
Sit down.
But not me
Not now
From my room
Will you be good?
Then we will go.
An angry cat
Write your name.
That dog is big.
Two of us
The first word
I like him.
Out of the water
We were here.
Could you go?
We like to write.
Into the water
Look for some people.
So there you are.
A long time
Have you seen it?
One more time
All day long
It’s about time.
Up in the air
Which way?
He has it.
If we were older
It’s no use.
With his mom
As big as the first
When will we go?
From here to there
More people
Go down.
Did you like it?
When did they go?
She said to go.
Each of us
What are these?
There was an old man.
It may fall down.
See the water
But not for me
Write it down.
Who will make it?
What will they do?
We had their dog.
When would you go?
A number of people
How long are they?
Come and get it.
Part of the time
Can you see?
Now and then
Go find her.
At your house
It’s been a long time.
Give them to me.
Now is the time.
May I go first?
This is my cat.
Get on the bus.
Did you see it?
How did they get it?
Number two
Look up.
All or some
A long way to go
For some of your people
The other people
Over the river
After the game
Take a little.
Just the same
It’s only me.
Think before you act
Live and play.
Try your best.
Any old time
Study and learn
Mother means it.
The good American
A little boy
Back off.
We want to go.
Turn the page.
A small house also
It’s still here.
Set it up.
I study in school.
I don’t feel well.
Point it out.
Read the sentence.
Big and small
Such a big house
Show and tell
They went here.
Good and plenty
Even the animals
I think so.
A good man
Another great sound
Our best things
Only a little
That’s very good
Three years ago
Where are you?
I work too much.
We found it here.
Right now
Spell your name.
Tell the truth.
Play it again.
We came home.
Answer the phone.
Form two lines.
Read my letters.
Write one sentence.
We need more.
Where does it end?
Such a mess
It turned out well.
It’s a small world.
Hand it over.
Around the clock
A different land
Tell the truth.
Because we should.
It turned out well.
Good things
My new place
Most of the animals
Give it back.
My last name
I know why.
Mother says to now.
I need help.
Move over.
Through the line
Kind of nice
Same time tomorrow
Change your clothes
The following day
Give it away.
Show us around.
The air is warm.
Another old picture
Where in the world
Put it there.
I’m an American.
My home is large.
Right now
This must be it.
Home sweet home
The men asked for help.
You must be right.
Get to the point.
Help me out.
It’s your place.
Read the book.
Near the car
A few good men
In the country
It seemed too good.
Below the water
It’s hard to open.
Keep it up.
In the beginning
The light in your eyes
We got together
We saw the food.
It’s my life.
We started the fire.
Run for miles.
Do it often.
It’s time to eat.
A second later
Talk to my father.
Sing your song.
My family
A very important person
Watch the game.
So far so good.
I like being on the team.
The dark night
A few children
Watch the river.
He started to cry.
Leave it to me.
The first day of school
Stay a while.
My own father
You might be right.
Read every story.
Next time
Will it last?
For example
Light the fire.
A group of friends
Under the earth
Both children
The big city
Read the paper.
A good thought
Is it really true?
Until the end
Near the sea
Read your book.
The long list
I miss you.
Above the clouds
I took the car.
Without a care
My feet hurt.
Next to me
It began to grow.
A group of Indians
Too soon
An important idea
Almost enough
Between the lines
Don’t open the door.
Add it up.
Along the way
Plants and flowers
Something good
Plant the trees.
Those other people
In my head
We left it here.
Close the door.
Always be kind.
It never happened.
Once upon a time.
We walked four miles.
Le me carry it.
Stop the music.
The young face
State your case.
I cut myself.
On my side
The peaceful Indians
The young girl
The tall mountains
A good idea
A long life
White clouds
I hear the sea.
I hear the waves.
Almost four miles
