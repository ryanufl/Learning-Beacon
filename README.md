Welcome to Learning Beacon!

Learning Beacon is an education tool used to enhance elementary school student's learning experience. Currently, there is a math game, typing game, and grammar game.

In the math game, you can play infinitely with randomly generated questions using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

In the typing game, you can play infinitely while practicing typing and getting a visualization of the keyboard and your key strokes. However, there are currently only a set amount of phrases, found in "testSWEProject/typingLines.txt". To add your own phrases, or sentneces, simply create a new line and type away. In this build, be careful not to use a sentence that is too long, as this is not yet supported.

In the grammar game, you can answer questions testing your grammar knowledge. Currently, there are a limited number of questions, and they can only be editted by changing the code, however, this may change in the future.

Current future plans are expanding the grammar game to allow for easier entering of questions, statistics for different games, such as accuracy, questions answered, typing speed(words per minute), and more.
